In this repository I keep a record of some talks that I held.  It has
some css files, a few images and a small script that uses ``rst2html``
to turn a ``ReStructuredText`` file into a ``presentation.html`` file.
I can then open this in Firefox, go to full screen mode, and navigate
to the next slide with Tab.

I first used this in a presentation in 2010.  I may have used it a few
times since, but at least for an internationalization talk I gave at
the Plone Conference 2012 in Arnhem, for which the talk and the sample
package can be found in my `maurits.i18ntalk`_ repository.

It works for me, fits my use case, my brain and my laptop.  Feel free
to copy this and adapt it to your needs.  Note that ``static/all.css``
is always used and you can choose to add either ``small.css``,
``medium.css`` or ``big.css`` (see ``makepresentation.sh``).  Pick one
that fits the monitor or beamer you are using.
